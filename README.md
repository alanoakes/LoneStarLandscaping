# Lone Star Lawn Care

This is a business website for Lone Star Lawn Care. I found this local
lawncare company [website](https://lawnlove.com/tennessee/memphis-lawn-care/cordova-lawn-care) that is very user friendly and can
use it as a UI reference.

This is only needing to be a one page website and I'm using this [bootstrap example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/carousel/#) as the template.
